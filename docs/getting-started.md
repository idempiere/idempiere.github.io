# Getting Started

Welcome to iDempiere! This guide will help you quickly get started with the system by walking you through the essential first steps.

## Understanding the Home Screen

Once logged in, you will see the iDempiere home screen, which consists of:

* The **Menu Box** is the primary navigation panel in iDempiere. It provides access to all the system's features and functionalities.  
  * Located on the top side of the screen, next to the search bar.  
  * Displays a tree structure with collapsible categories.  
  * Users can expand or collapse sections to find the desired module or functionality.  
* The **Menu Button** is used to show or hide the Menu Box for better screen utilization.  
  * Clicking it toggles the visibility of the Menu Box.  
* The **Global Search Box** allows users to quickly find records, windows, reports, or processes within iDempiere.  
  * Located in the header, at the top-left corner of the screen.  
  * Enables keyword-based searching across multiple system areas.  
  * Helps users quickly access frequently used functions without manually browsing the menu.  
  * Shows result suggestions while you type to speed up navigation.  
* **Widgets** are the panels on and around your home screen. These widgets can be dragged/moved around.
  * Favourites widget  
    * The Favourites widget helps a specific user organize their most commonly used windows, reports and processes.  
    * You may group your favourites into folders to help organize and personalize your experience.  
  * Recent Items widget  
    * The Recent Items widget contains links to the **ten** most recent documents that you have created or updated.  Every time you “touch” a record in a window a recent item link is created and set on the top of the list.  
    * If you want to delete a recent item from the list you can drag it and drop it into the trashcan button below.  
    * NOTE that the number of items defaults to ten, but it can be configured to show more or less by your administrator.  
  * Activities widget  
    * The Activities widget is intended to call your attention to documents or actions that you need to take care of.  
    * See [Activities Widget](#activities-widget) for more information.
  * Views widget  
    * The Views widget helps highlight commonly used Info Windows.  
    * Info Windows helps you explore information in iDempiere about specific topics. See [Info Window](#info-window) section below...
