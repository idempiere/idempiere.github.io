# Business Partner

## Introduction
Business Partner is the generic name for all the people/companies with a business
relationship with your tenant/client: that includes, vendors, customers, employees
and so on. Sometimes we need to configure groups, taxes and other specific
properties for invoicing or to manage them properly, so please be sure that you
understand the following capabilities for them

## Creating a Business Partner
The Business Partner window allows you to define any partner with
whom you perform transactions.  
There are different types of Business Partners, these include: Customers, Vendor or
Suppliers, Employees and Sales Representatives each one of these represent a
different role and function within the company.
Menu: **Partner Relations -> Business Partner Rules -> Business Partner **

## Customers

### Introduction

A customer is a subject or entity that accesses resources, products or services
provided by another. For business, the customer is the individual who, through a
financial transaction, acquires a product and / or
service of any kind (technological, gastronomic, decorative, furniture or property,
etc.). A customer is synonymous with a buyer or consumer.
A customer corresponds to a business partner with whom the company makes
sales transactions and of which special information such as account statements,
credit quota, discounts granted, price list, among others are needed. In
iDempiere, the qualification of the Customer is granted to a business
partner created, for which you will see that the windows and the concepts will
always refer to the Business Partner. The above means that a Business Partner can
be marked as a customer and in turn as an employee and as a vendor (supplier).

### Business Partner Group

The Customers are created first instance as business partners and selecting the
Customer field. A business partner group must be assigned to the registry.
Menu: **Partner Relations â€“> Business Partner Rules -> Business Partner Group**
In iDempiere it is possible to group the business partner by similar
characteristics through this group option of third parties, either to generate reports
or carry out massive processes such as changes in accounting
accounts, price lists and discounts.
You can create N groups of business partners in iDempiere for example:
PARTNERS, VIP CUSTOMERS,INTERNAL CUSTOMERS, STAR SUPPLIERS ..
As an example, the following Customer registry is created:

This gives direct access to information on business with the customer, a.o. actual life time value and first sale. 

d) Tabs with further connected information

There are a number of tabs to select below the basic data: **Contact (User)** with subtabs Interest Area and BP Access, then other main Tabs for **Location, Bank Account, Shipping Accounts, Customer Accounting and Printed Form Control**.

For aspects like accounting and Form Control usually general data is sufficient, but for the **Location** usually every Business partner needs specific data. 

### Configuration of a Vendor or Supplier

## Introduction

A vendor (supplier) can be a person or a company that supplies other companies with stocks (items) or services necessary for the development of the activity.
The Vendors (Suppliers) correspond to the business partner with whom the company makes Purchase transactions and of which we need to know special information such as account statements, discounts granted to us, price list among
others.
Depending on the type of items or service provided by our vendor (supplier), we can differentiate them into e.g. 3 types (or more):

- Vendor(Supplier) of goods: this would be in charge of providing the company with articles and tangible objects.

- Service Vendor: this type of supplier does not provide material but provides a service or activity so that their clients can in turn perform their functions in the company. For example, as suppliers of generic services that every company needs would be telephone companies, water and electricity.

- Vendor(Supplier) of resources: these would be in charge of covering the economic needs of the company, for example, banks or financial entities.

In Idempiere, the qualification of the vendor is that granted to a business partner registry created, for which we will see that the windows and the concepts will always refer to Business Partner.
The above means that a Business Partner can be marked as a vendor (supplier)
and in turn as an employee and as a customer.

## Business Partner Group

The Vendor(Suppliers) are created in the first instance as business partners and selecting the Vendor field. A business partner group must be assigned to the registry.
