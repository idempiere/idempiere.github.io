Code standards: Follow Java standards (meaningful names, camelCase).Use proper indentation and formatting for readability.Add the GPLv2 License Header to each new Java class.When adding, removing, or changing the signature of a public method: Prefer method overloading instead of changing existing method signatures. This preserves backward compatibility and helps plugins continue working.If you change the signature of a class or interface, regenerate the serialVersionUID if applicable. This ensures compatibility when serializing Java classes. Run and maintain unit tests: Ensure that all existing unit tests pass before submitting your pull request.If your contribution introduces new logic or fixes a bug, consider adding new unit tests to verify the behavior.

Components of iDempiere Window Some important areas are: FavoritesRecent itemsActivitiesViews not seen above further right areCalendarPerformance (Dashboard)Help / Quick Info area (optionally displayable) Favorites The favorites are user specific. In this view you can add processes and / or documents to which you can access more frequently, gaining time and accessing more quickly. You can also remove them using the delete icon. You can define new favorites just by dragging &amp; dropping the items (using your mouse) from the menu to this area. For a better organization, favorites can be ordered like a tree within folders, and with the &quot;Automatic Launch&quot; button you can define options that are automatically opened when you start a session. Recent items In this view you can see the records or documents that were recently modified by the logged-in user. In the same way they can be deleted dragging and dropping the recent item into delete icon. tip You can add a record to the Recent Items by editing a field of the record and then canceling the edition. Activities Here you can quickly review some statistics number configured in your system. They are shown as a title and a number indicating the number of records that are present in this type of activity. Some of them are: Notice, Request, Workflow Activities and Unprocessed Documents. This list be different vary depending on your role and the configuration of your system. Views Here you can see the direct links to the most frequent info windows, among them Business Partner and others. Info windows are quick ways to access crucial data from the ERP-system. Calendar The calendar can be used to display important dates for the user which must be defined in the respective business activities using the Requests feature. Performance (Dashboard) Here you can see computed values in graphical charts of important business data. They usually are tailored for each company and often for single user groups. There are different types of windows you can access from the menu, a) Windows for data entry and display b) Report c) Processed d) Info Windows Most important are data entry and display windows.

Other tabs containing detailed contents of the object will not be copied (e.g. copy of a product will not copy the prices.) To accomplish this, other dedicated functions are required. Save RecordDelete Record Warning! This action is irreversibleUndo action You can undo edits that have not been saved yet to the database.Requery / Refresh The information that you see on the screen could have been changed by another user, or by a process executed. This button forces a read from the database to see the most fresh information in case that happened.Grid toggle This button allows to switch between the mono-record and multi-record viewsAttachment Any record can manage attached files using this button.Zoom across (cross references associated records/documents) Clicking this button shows a list of related records on other windows. Better to be used with care as this option can be expensive and time consuming.Report This button allows to generate reports from the record or records selected, these are usually tabular reports in HTML, PDF, CSV or Spreadsheet formatsProcess (advanced actions if available) Some records allow to run associated process (for example copying the lines of an order), you can find additional processes in this &quot;Gear&quot; button.Print Some documents have a printable format designed, you can generate those formats with this button.Back to parent recordNavigate to detail recordLabel / Tag This allows to define and see Labels or Tags associated to the current record.More options: More options (for functions in data and order entry windows The diverse functions to be accessed through &quot;More options&quot; can be moved by the system administrator to the main row of functions directly visible.

This button opens such quick form.Import File Loader Some advanced roles can import CSV files directly into the tab, this option allows to import arbitrary CSV files (following certain column naming conventions).CSV Import File Loader This button is shown when there is a predefined CSV configuration for the current tab. The user can then import multiple records in one step. The above functions are partially self explaining, like New Record.

Charges are used in transactional windows such as the Invoice (Vendor) window and Physical Inventory window to code value to given accounts. It is commonly asked why the concept of a Charge exists. Asked another way, why not let the user simply choose the account directly? There are important reasons the Charge exists: Charges give ERP Administrators the ability to provide meaningful names to actions an operator might perform where the operator would have no knowledge of the underlying GL account number or meaning. Example of a Charge name that means something to a warehouse operator: &quot;Damaged Inventory (62300)&quot;. Example of a GL account name that might be meaningless to a warehouse operator: &quot;62300 - Material Discrepancy&quot;.Charges give you the ability to have multiple operator descriptions for the same GL account. Doing so ensures the correctly named options are available to operators in the right circumstances.iDempiere supports multiple Accounting Schemas (functional currencies) with multiple Account Elements (charts of accounts). This means that a transactional document can use a single Charge option regardless of the document's functional currencies. iDempiere knows exactly what account to use when posting to the respective functional currencies.

Products have the following added complexities over Charges: Products depend on Price ListsProducts can maintain inventory levelsProducts maintain costsProducts support Bills of Materials (BOM)Products maintain multiple GL accounts (where a Charge maps to a single GL account)Product GL account usage depends on how the Product is configuredProducts are integrated with Assets and Resources Many windows give you a choice between using a Product or a Charge (Sales Order =&gt; Order Line subtab for example).
