Please do not mix unrelated commits. For example, if your change includes a refactoring, submit: One commit for the refactoringAnother commit for the actual solution Data access hierarchy: Use the following methods in order of preference when retrieving data: Model Classes ‚Äì Most M* classes have convenient get methods.Query class ‚Äì Clean and efficient for many use cases.DB class (DB.get()) ‚Äì Use with care.JDBC (raw access) ‚Äì Only if absolutely necessary, as it impacts memory and performance. Code standards: Follow Java standards (meaningful names, camelCase).Use proper indentation and formatting for readability.Add the GPLv2 License Header to each new Java class.When adding, removing, or changing the signature of a public method: Prefer method overloading instead of changing existing method signatures. This preserves backward compatibility and helps plugins continue working.If you change the signature of a class or interface, regenerate the serialVersionUID if applicable. This ensures compatibility when serializing Java classes. Run and maintain unit tests: Ensure that all existing unit tests pass before submitting your pull request.If your contribution introduces new logic or fixes a bug, consider adding new unit tests to verify the behavior. Perform a collateral impact analysis: Even if your change affects only one line, check: Where that method/class is referenced elsewhereWhether your change introduces unexpected behaviorAll relevant test cases Avoid common pitfalls: Review the list of Common Issues before submitting your patch.

Organizations inside the same Tenant can share information. There exists a special Organization named &quot;*&quot; or commonly referred to as &quot;star&quot;. While the &quot;*&quot; Organization is a real organization, it is commonly used to share data by convention. Said another way, if you wish to make a given record available to all users and records in your Tenant, assign that record the &quot;*&quot; Organization.

Any given Business Partner can be flagged as either or all of the following roles: customer, vendor, employee, internal or external sales representative, or prospect.

Note that the User window includes all Users and Contacts for a given Tenant. "},{"title":"Role‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Vocabulary","url":"/docs/basic-functional/vocabulary#role","content":"A Role defines the attributes and abilities of a User logging into an iDempiere session. A User can have many Roles. A User must choose one (and only one) Role during the login process. The User's iDempiere experience is defined by the chosen role during login. "},{"title":"Charge‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Vocabulary","url":"/docs/basic-functional/vocabulary#charge","content":"A Charge is a facade for accounts in the Chart of Accounts (Account Element window =&gt; Element Value subtab). Charges are used in transactional windows such as the Invoice (Vendor) window and Physical Inventory window to code value to given accounts. It is commonly asked why the concept of a Charge exists. Asked another way, why not let the user simply choose the account directly? There are important reasons the Charge exists: Charges give ERP Administrators the ability to provide meaningful names to actions an operator might perform where the operator would have no knowledge of the underlying GL account number or meaning. Example of a Charge name that means something to a warehouse operator: &quot;Damaged Inventory (62300)&quot;. Example of a GL account name that might be meaningless to a warehouse operator: &quot;62300 - Material Discrepancy&quot;.Charges give you the ability to have multiple operator descriptions for the same GL account. Doing so ensures the correctly named options are available to operators in the right circumstances.iDempiere supports multiple Accounting Schemas (functional currencies) with multiple Account Elements (charts of accounts). This means that a transactional document can use a single Charge option regardless of the document's functional currencies. iDempiere knows exactly what account to use when posting to the respective functional currencies. "},{"title":"Product‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Vocabulary","url":"/docs/basic-functional/vocabulary#product","content":"A Product is used to represent many concepts in iDempiere. A Product can be: A stocked product like a chairA not-Stocked product like waterA service that you perform Products are similar to Charges in that they help the system map transactions to GL accounts; however, the Product architecture is much more involved. Products have the following added complexities over Charges: Products depend on Price ListsProducts can maintain inventory levelsProducts maintain costsProducts support Bills of Materials (BOM)Products maintain multiple GL accounts (where a Charge maps to a single GL account)Product GL account usage depends on how the Product is configuredProducts are integrated with Assets and Resources Many windows give you a choice between using a Product or a Charge (Sales Order =&gt; Order Line subtab for example). If you do not know whether to use a Product or a Charge, start by using a Charge. It is more simple. Use Products when you have a requirement that cannot be solved by a Charge. "},{"title":"Accounting Schema‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Vocabulary","url":"/docs/basic-functional/vocabulary#accounting-schema","content":"The Accounting Schema window is where you begin configuring iDempiere's accounting engine.

You may maintain as many Accounting Schemas as you deem appropriate. Here are common reasons to have more than one Accounting Schema record: You maintain and report financials from more than one currency.You maintain and report financials from both 'Cash' and 'Accrual' costing methods.You meed to maintain multiple charts of accounts.

Every business activity which creates or changes values in the company is normally reflected by accounting entries. In this context, it is important to note that the accounts are structured by the accounts tree. It defines which account is a base or root account for a specific value category and which other account is for accumulating the values of these root accounts and of other accumulation accounts. Also in the accounts definition it can be controlled which accounts can only be posted by automatic actions of the system e.g. by a production order, and which accounts are debited or credited by journal entries of the company staff.

Users can expand or collapse sections to find the desired module or functionality. The Menu Button is used to show or hide the Menu Box for better screen utilization. Clicking it toggles the visibility of the Menu Box. The Global Search Box allows users to quickly find records, windows, reports, or processes within iDempiere.

Helps users quickly access frequently used functions without manually browsing the menu. Shows result suggestions while you type to speed up navigation. Widgets are the panels on and around your home screen. These widgets can be dragged/moved around. Favourites widget The Favourites widget helps a specific user organize their most commonly used windows, reports and processes. You may group your favourites into folders to help organize and personalize your experience. Recent Items widget The Recent Items widget contains links to the ten most recent documents that you have created or updated.
