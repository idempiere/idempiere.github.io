Depending on the type of items or service provided by our vendor (supplier), we can differentiate them into e.g. 3 types (or more): Vendor(Supplier) of goods: this would be in charge of providing the company with articles and tangible objects.

Because different tenants are unrelated, they do not share any information with each other.

Organizations inside the same Tenant can share information. There exists a special Organization named &quot;*&quot; or commonly referred to as &quot;star&quot;.

Charges are used in transactional windows such as the Invoice (Vendor) window and Physical Inventory window to code value to given accounts. It is commonly asked why the concept of a Charge exists. Asked another way, why not let the user simply choose the account directly? There are important reasons the Charge exists: Charges give ERP Administrators the ability to provide meaningful names to actions an operator might perform where the operator would have no knowledge of the underlying GL account number or meaning. Example of a Charge name that means something to a warehouse operator: &quot;Damaged Inventory (62300)&quot;. Example of a GL account name that might be meaningless to a warehouse operator: &quot;62300 - Material Discrepancy&quot;.Charges give you the ability to have multiple operator descriptions for the same GL account. Doing so ensures the correctly named options are available to operators in the right circumstances.iDempiere supports multiple Accounting Schemas (functional currencies) with multiple Account Elements (charts of accounts). This means that a transactional document can use a single Charge option regardless of the document's functional currencies. iDempiere knows exactly what account to use when posting to the respective functional currencies. "},{"title":"Product‚Äã","type":1,"pageTitle":"Vocabulary","url":"/docs/basic-functional/vocabulary#product","content":"A Product is used to represent many concepts in iDempiere. A Product can be: A stocked product like a chairA not-Stocked product like waterA service that you perform Products are similar to Charges in that they help the system map transactions to GL accounts; however, the Product architecture is much more involved. Products have the following added complexities over Charges: Products depend on Price ListsProducts can maintain inventory levelsProducts maintain costsProducts support Bills of Materials (BOM)Products maintain multiple GL accounts (where a Charge maps to a single GL account)Product GL account usage depends on how the Product is configuredProducts are integrated with Assets and Resources Many windows give you a choice between using a Product or a Charge (Sales Order =&gt; Order Line subtab for example). If you do not know whether to use a Product or a Charge, start by using a Charge. It is more simple. Use Products when you have a requirement that cannot be solved by a Charge.

You may maintain as many Accounting Schemas as you deem appropriate.

Every business activity which creates or changes values in the company is normally reflected by accounting entries. In this context, it is important to note that the accounts are structured by the accounts tree. It defines which account is a base or root account for a specific value category and which other account is for accumulating the values of these root accounts and of other accumulation accounts. Also in the accounts definition it can be controlled which accounts can only be posted by automatic actions of the system e.g. by a production order, and which accounts are debited or credited by journal entries of the company staff.

Components of iDempiere Window Some important areas are: FavoritesRecent itemsActivitiesViews not seen above further right areCalendarPerformance (Dashboard)Help / Quick Info area (optionally displayable) Favorites The favorites are user specific. In this view you can add processes and / or documents to which you can access more frequently, gaining time and accessing more quickly. You can also remove them using the delete icon. You can define new favorites just by dragging &amp; dropping the items (using your mouse) from the menu to this area. For a better organization, favorites can be ordered like a tree within folders, and with the &quot;Automatic Launch&quot; button you can define options that are automatically opened when you start a session. Recent items In this view you can see the records or documents that were recently modified by the logged-in user. In the same way they can be deleted dragging and dropping the recent item into delete icon. tip You can add a record to the Recent Items by editing a field of the record and then canceling the edition. Activities Here you can quickly review some statistics number configured in your system. They are shown as a title and a number indicating the number of records that are present in this type of activity. Some of them are: Notice, Request, Workflow Activities and Unprocessed Documents. This list be different vary depending on your role and the configuration of your system. Views Here you can see the direct links to the most frequent info windows, among them Business Partner and others. Info windows are quick ways to access crucial data from the ERP-system. Calendar The calendar can be used to display important dates for the user which must be defined in the respective business activities using the Requests feature. Performance (Dashboard) Here you can see computed values in graphical charts of important business data. They usually are tailored for each company and often for single user groups.

Other tabs containing detailed contents of the object will not be copied (e.g. copy of a product will not copy the prices.) To accomplish this, other dedicated functions are required. Save RecordDelete Record Warning! This action is irreversibleUndo action You can undo edits that have not been saved yet to the database.Requery / Refresh The information that you see on the screen could have been changed by another user, or by a process executed. This button forces a read from the database to see the most fresh information in case that happened.Grid toggle This button allows to switch between the mono-record and multi-record viewsAttachment Any record can manage attached files using this button.Zoom across (cross references associated records/documents) Clicking this button shows a list of related records on other windows. Better to be used with care as this option can be expensive and time consuming.Report This button allows to generate reports from the record or records selected, these are usually tabular reports in HTML, PDF, CSV or Spreadsheet formatsProcess (advanced actions if available) Some records allow to run associated process (for example copying the lines of an order), you can find additional processes in this &quot;Gear&quot; button.Print Some documents have a printable format designed, you can generate those formats with this button.Back to parent recordNavigate to detail recordLabel / Tag This allows to define and see Labels or Tags associated to the current record.More options: More options (for functions in data and order entry windows The diverse functions to be accessed through &quot;More options&quot; can be moved by the system administrator to the main row of functions directly visible.
